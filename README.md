Overview

This project offers tools for triangulating point clouds and managing files in XYZ and OBJ formats. Utilizing the CGAL library for triangulation.

Dependencies
The project depends on the following libraries:

CGAL (Computational Geometry Algorithms Library): Used for the core triangulation algorithms.
Boost: A set of libraries for C++ programming, required by CGAL for various functionalities.
Eigen3: A high-level C++ library for linear algebra? required by CGAL for geometric computations.

Before compiling, ensure all dependencies are properly installed and configured in your development environment. 
Compile the project using your preferred C++ compiler, ensuring the paths to the CGAL, BOOST, and Eigen3 libraries are correctly specified.
